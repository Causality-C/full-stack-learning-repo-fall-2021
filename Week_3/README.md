# Week 3: NodeJS, Calling Third Party APIs, and NOSQL Basics
# Learning Objectives
- Basics of JS and NodeJS
- Building, Testing, and Interacting with APIs 
- Understanding how NOSQL/Document Databases operate at a high level
# Classwork
Today, we will be interacting with TheDogAPI, a public third party API which allows users to view different dog breeds and vote for their favorite dog pics. Additionally, we will be writing our own API to interact with TheDogAPI to perform specific actions: 

1. Getting the first 10 dog breeds from the API
2. Allowing users to vote for multiple pictures by passing in an array of image ids
3. Getting all the votes for a particular user (can hard code user api token)

Although NodeJS code is provided in a step by step manner to follow, it is recommended to code independently

We will be using the following NodeJS modules
1. **Express**: API creation service: spins up middlewares to respond to HTTP Requests.
2. **Supervisor**: watches for code changes and gives developers hot-reloading behavior (no need to restart application after each change).
3. **Axios**: HTTP client library which allows the sending of HTTP requests.

Be sure to have registered for an account on [TheDogAPI Website](https://thedogapi.com/signup) and received an API Key.

## Getting Started
1. Navigate to the classwork directory 
2. Install the project packages using 
    ```
    npm install express supervisor axios
    ```
    NPM will automatically generate a package.json file where you can confirm that the requirements libraries have been satisfied.
